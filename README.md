# DJINN-Compiler
Just a basic compiler/interpreter project made to Language Processing subject

## Objective

The purpose of this paper is to incrementally implement:
- an operational semantics;
- a grammar (LR) with the respective lexer and parser;
- a small interpreter (based on the proposed operational semantics);
- a small compiler;


for an elementary programming language called Natrix. .


The natrix.nx file introduces the syntax of the Natrix language.

## Goals achieved

### Interpreter:

- Binary operations (+,
- Boolean Operations (and, or
- Comparisons (==, <,>, <=,> =,! =)
- Whole constants and bools
- Foreach cycles
- If else conditions
- Define and perform operations on variables
- Define ranges and arrays
- Prints

### Compiler:

Generates assembly code to:

- Binary operations (+,
- Prints
